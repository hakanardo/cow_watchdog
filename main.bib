abstract="Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a set of numbers to be the mutual distances of a set of real points in Euclidean space, and matrices are found whose ranks determine the dimension of the smallest Euclidean space containing such points. Methods are indicated for determining the configuration of these points, and for approximating to them by points in a space of lower dimensionality.",
