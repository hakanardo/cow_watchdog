\section{Introduction}

XXX scientists are interested in studying the social interactions between cows in diary farms. Typically that is performed by defining a set of interaction events such as head butting, body pushing, social licking, mounting, ... Then an expert studies a scene of interest for large amount mount of time and counts them number of each event. Some of these evens are quite rare, which means that a lot of expert time have to be spent in looking at uninteresting events.

In this paper the goal is to take the first step towards an automated system. The scene of interest will be filmed using video cameras. Then an automated watchdog will remove a lot of the uninteresting parts of that video. The remaining video will still have to be studied by experts, but the time spent looking at uninteresting video will be significantly reduced.
